# Election_Analysis

## 1. Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of the election audit analysis
-The purpose of the election audit analysis is to read and organize data from a csv file, which containing election results by ballot ID, and each ballot ID containing both county and candiate information. Using Python, each unique ballot ID was counted once under each county and candidate name. Then we used python to print out each unique candidate name or county name with their respective number of votes and percentage of votes(out of total votes). The largest county turnout and the winning candidate (with vote count and percentage of total votes) were both captured. At the end, the results were printed both to the terminal and write to a text file.

## 2. Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
- How many votes were casted in this congressional election? 
  - 36911 votes were counted.
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
  - Jefferson county has 38,855 actual votes, which accounted for 10.5% of the total votes. Denver county has 306,055 actual votes, which accounted for 82.8% of the total votes. Arapaphoe county only has 24,801 votes, which accounted for 6.7% of the total votes.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
  - Denver county has the largest number of votes at 306,055, which is 82.8%.

## 3. Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used -with some modification- for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for any elections.
